## üíª Setup

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Start the development server: `npm start`.

## Creating a 3D Model

1. Install [`npm install -g gltf-pipeline`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gltf-pipeline)
2. Then convert the `.gltf` to a `.glb`, using this command `gltf-pipeline -i model.gltf -o model.glb`
3. Then create a JSX Component from the `.glb` file you just converted using this command [`npx gltfjsx <file>.glb`](https://github.com/pmndrs/gltfjsx)
4. Copy the `.jsx` file and the `.glb` to the component folder in your react app.
